# module-3-challenge
In this challenge, we have to generate the password.
We do not need to change anything in the style code; Meaning we do not need to change anything in the HTML and CSS.
The only thing that we need to change to create the password and the code work without any error is to code in JAVASCRIPT.
We have to make sure the length of the password is greater than 8 and less than 128 characters. 
We have to make sure the person using this password-generated website, has to use at least one of these options. (upper, lowercase characters, numerics, and special characters.)
